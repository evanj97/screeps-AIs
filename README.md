# screeps-AIs
Collection of AI scripts for the programming game Screeps.  Written in JavaScript, TypeScript and Web Assembly supporting languages.


## IDE autocomplete support
Add a file named `Autocomplete` to the repo, and place any libraries in said folder for IDEs that support autocomplete.  The `Autocomplete` folder is included in the `.gitignore` to keep the repo size small.

#### Libraries used:
* [ScreepsAutocomplete](https://github.com/Garethp/ScreepsAutocomplete) for JS autocomplete

## NEON Javascript AI
My first serious attempt at scripting in Screeps.  Keeping it vanilla, so entirely in JS.
